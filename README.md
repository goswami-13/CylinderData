# CylinderData

This repository contains the flow around cylinder dataset from Dynamic Mode Decomposition: Data-Driven Modeling of Complex Systems. This dataset contains the velocity fields (u and v), as well as vorticity field data for the flow around a circular cylinder at Re = 100. There are 151 snapshots available.
